# Multi-Robot Task Allocation and Path Planning

This project explores task allocation and path planning strategies for multiple robots
operating in a shared environment using a custom Python-based simulator.

## Objectives
- Simulate multiple robots in a grid-based environment
- Implement task allocation algorithms:
  - Greedy
  - Auction-based
  - Hungarian (optimal)
- Use A* for path planning
- Compare algorithms using performance metrics

## Metrics
- Makespan
- Total distance traveled
- Idle time

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pygame (simulation)
- Jupyter Notebook (analysis)
- Matplotlib

## Project Status
🚧 Initial setup
